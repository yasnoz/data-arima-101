## ARIMA with Seasonality

Throughout the lecture, you were introduced to a lot of tools to model a Time Series (ARIMA, seasonal decomposition, using `.diff()` etc.). In this exercise, we're going to take some more time to understand them properly - pulling apart a real time series with seasonality (and with some holes in the data!) to model CO2 emissions in Hawaii on a monthly basis.

To get started, open up the `arima_seasonal_intro.ipynb`!
